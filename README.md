To build the code, use build.sh. It tries to detect your java home directory on a Linux machine, but if it can't find it, you'll have to modify the script to point to it. Make sure you have Thrift downloaded too!

Once you've run the build script, it will give you the exact command line instruction you need for each of the three process types on a single machine localhost. Feel free to change the host and ports if you'd like to run it across multiple machines.
